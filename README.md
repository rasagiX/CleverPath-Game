CleverPath: The Quiz & Maze
CleverPath is a browser-based game that combines an age-based trivia quiz with a retro pixel maze bonus level. The goal is to answer questions correctly, earn keys, and unlock a hidden maze challenge.


# How it works:
1. The player first selects an age group (5–11, 12–18, 18+).
2. The game shows multiple-choice questions tailored to the selected age group.
3. If the player answers a question correctly on the first attempt, they earn a key.
4. After collecting 3 keys, a bonus Maze Runner game is unlocked.
The interface includes level indicators, a key counter, dark mode toggle, background music, and small animations for correct/wrong answers.


# Tech stack:
1. HTML5 for structure and pages
2. CSS3 for layout, retro pixel styling, and responsive design
3. JavaScript (ES6) for quiz logic, key tracking, level system, and bonus game unlock
No external frameworks or backend – everything runs in the browser
